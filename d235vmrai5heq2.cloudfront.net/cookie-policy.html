        <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
        <p>At Zenler, we believe in being transparent about how we collect and use data. This policy provides information about how and when we use cookies for these purposes. 
            Capitalized terms used in this policy but not defined have the meaning set forth in our <a href='privacy-policy.html' >Privacy Policy</a>, 
            which also includes additional details about the collection and use of information at Zenler.</p><h2>What is a cookie?</h2><p>Cookies are small text files sent by us to 
            your computer or mobile device. They are unique to your account or your browser. They records how you move your way around a website so that, when you revisit that website, 
            it can present tailored options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes. 
        </p>
        <p>Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete 
            them or until they expire.</p>
        <p>Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system. </p>
        <p><br><br> </p>
        <p>To find out more about cookies, visit 
            <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">this site</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Does Zenler use cookies?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Zenler uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and 
            web beacons. We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Zenler sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Zenler and its corporate 
            affiliates (collectively, the "Sites"). In addition, we use third party cookies, like Google Analytics.
        </p>
        <h2>How is Zenler using cookies?</h2>
        <p>We use cookies to track your use of our website.  This enables us to understand how you use the site and track any patterns with regards how you are using our website.
            Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which workspaces you are logged into. 
            Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and allow us to carry out analytics and customization, among other similar things.
        </p>
        <p>Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit a Site or use our Services, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that's consistent with your 
            settings. This helps us to develop and improve our website as well as products and / or services in response to what you might need or want. Cookies also make your interactions 
            faster and more secure.</p>
        <p>Categories of use:</p>
        <p><strong>Session cookies:</strong> these are only stored on your computer during your web session and are automatically 
            deleted when you close your browser - they usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page but they do not collect 
            any personal data from your computer; or
        </p>
        <p><strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> a persistent cookie is stored as a file on your computer and it remains there when you close 
            your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again. We may use persistent cookies for Zenler Analytics , Google Analytics,  
            Mixpanel Analytics or Segment.io Analytics.
        </p>
        <p>Cookies can also be categorised as follows: </p>
        <p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies:</strong> These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when buying a product and / or service, 
            and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on our website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you 
            that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Performance &amp; Analytical cookies:</strong> These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our website. For example, they allow us to count visits, 
            identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you 
            with news or updates relevant to the services you use. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The 
            information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.
        </p>
        <h2>What can you do if you don't want cookies to be set or want them to be removed?</h2>
        <p>
            Some people prefer not to allow cookies, which is why most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit you. In some browsers you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more fine-grained control over your privacy. What this means is that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management in their products. Please see below for more information.

          If you limit the ability of websites and applications to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience and/or lose the ability to access the services, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings, like login information.
