        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            We understand that privacy and the security of your personal information is extremely important. 
            This policy sets out what we do with your information and what we do to keep it secure.  
            It also explains where and how we collect your personal information, as well as your rights over any personal information we hold about you. 
            This Policy explains how we do this and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When we refer to "Zenler", we mean the Zenler or New Zenler entity that acts as the Controller or the Processor of your personal information, as explained in detail in the 
            "Identifying the Data Controller and Data Processor" section below.
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Zenler’s online course platform (the <b>"Services"</b>) when interacting with the platform 
            (eg. When you are student/lead/subscriber to a Zenler Site that uses the Zenler application or services), <a href="https://www.zenler.com/">zenler.com</a>, <a href="https://www.newzenler.com/">newzenler.com</a> ( the <b>"Website"</b>) and other interactions 
            (e.g, when you create an account with Zenler, purchase or signup for a Zenler product or service, sign up to our newsletter,  signup to updates, open a support ticket, 
            when you contact us by email or phone or contact us via social media ) you may have with Zenler. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, 
            Websites or any other aspect of Zenler’s business.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Zenler platform (<b>"Third Party Services"</b>), or any other
            third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the <b>"Customer Agreement"</b>), including the 
            processing of any personal data including files or any  other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, <b>"Student Data"</b>). The Zenler Site 
            (e.g., Course Instructor, author, educator, online course creator or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (<b>"Customer"</b>) controls their instance of 
            the Services (their <b>"Zenler Site"</b>) and any associated Student Data. If you have any questions about specific Online School settings and privacy practices, please contact the 
            Customer whose Zenler Site you use. You can use the contact link on your online school or email <a href="mailto:support@zenler.com">support@zenler.com</a> to get the contact information of your Zenler Site  
            instructors and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a online school but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer 
            that sent the invitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy also applies to entities( <b>"Affiliate(s)"</b> ) that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the subject entity. <b>"Control"</b> for 
            purposes of this definition means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests of the subject entity.
        </p>
        <h2>Identifying The Data Controller And Data Processor</h2>
        <p>
            Data protection law in certain jurisdictions especially in the EU differentiates between the <b>"Data Controller"</b> or <b>"Controller</b>" and <b>"Data processor"</b> or <b>"Processor"</b> of information.
            In general, Customer is the controller of Student Data. In general, Zenler is the processor of Student Data related to users/students/leads/visitors who use Zenler Site and 
            the controller of Customer Data and Other Information.

        <h3>Disclosures of your Personal Data</h3>

            - Sendgrid<br>
            - FileStack<br>
            - Vimeo<br>
            - Zoom<br>

           <li>Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third 
            parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
        </p>
        <h2>International transfers </h2>
        <p>We share your personal data within our group of companies which involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
        <p>
            Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of 
            personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is 
            implemented:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
            <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</li>
            <li>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
            <li>Where we use providers based in the United States (for example Amazon, Sendgrid) we may transfer data to them where we have signed data processing addendums for the provider to provide protection of data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
        <p>
            Please email us at <a href="mailto:support@zenler.com">support@zenler.com</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA or if you want a 
            copy of our standard data processing addendum, incorporating Model Clauses.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. 
            In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only 
            process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or 
            reporting requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, 
            the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>

            being customers.

            further notice to you.
