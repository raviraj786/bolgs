        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>
            These Customer Terms of Service (the <strong>"Customer Terms"</strong>) describe your rights and responsibilities when using Zenler(New Zenler) course and marketing automation 
            platform and tools (the <strong>"Services"</strong>). Please read them carefully. If you are a Customer (defined below), these Customer Terms govern your access and use of our Services. If you 
            are using a Zenler Site set up by a Customer, refer to the Site’s terms of service that govern your access and use of the Services. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These Customer Terms (or, if applicable, your written agreement with us) and any Order Form(s) (defined below) together form a binding <strong>"Contract"</strong> between 
            Customer and us.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you sign up on behalf of a Customer, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Contract and agree to the Contract on behalf of Customer. Please make sure you have
            the necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of Customer before proceeding.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Customer and Customer’s Users</h2>
        <p><em><b>Use of the Services</b></em></p>
        <p>
            Customer must comply with the Contract and ensure that its Users/Site Visitors comply with the Contract and the User Terms. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we 
            have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content of any Customer Data or the way Customer or its Users choose to use the Services to store or process any 
            Customer Data. The Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 16. Customer must ensure that all  Users are over 16 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
            By agreeing to the Terms when you sign up as Customer, and creating an Account or Pay subscription fees for some of the features/services, you become a Zenler Customer. 
            There are various products and services available to Customers, and monthly prices applicable to such products and services. Zenler pricing is subject to change without notice.
            Price changes are effective on the first day of the month after the price change is posted, By agreeing to the terms and providing your credit card information you authorize 
            Zenler to charge your credit card in the amount indicated for the value of the services you select, including any future price changes. Unlimited plans are subject to fair usage policy. Email lists purchased from others are not permitted - this means while importing an email list or email into the platform you should make sure that your contacts on the list has opted-in to receive your communications.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Our Removal Rights</b></em></p>
        <p>
            Zenler retains the right to pull down Content or suspend Accounts containing Content that are threatening, offensive, defamatory, unlawful, libelous, pornographic,racism, 
            obscene, viruses or otherwise objectionable or if any content contains copy-right infringement, if it violates anyones intellectual property, involve in any fraudulent 
            activities using the site or these Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we believe that there is a violation of the Contract that can simply be remedied by Customer’s removal of certain Customer Data we will, in most cases, ask Customer to 
            take direct action rather than intervene. However, we may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action, if Customer does not take appropriate action,
            or if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Users, or any third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only if you are a zero commission paid subscription plan that allows enrolling students into Zenler from outside Zenler or if you have contract to do that from Zenler,  
            you can collect payments for your courses outside of Zenler service. If its found that there is an attempt to bypass Zenler payment system in such cases will result in 
            suspension or removal of the account. If you aim is to give NO commission to be given to Zenler, upgrade to the zero subscription paid plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zenler is not your backup service, so if it comes to our notice that our service is being used purely as a backup, we retain the right to take appropriate action including 
            suspension if the account in question in such cases.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Payment Obligations</h2>
        <p><em><b>Payment Terms</b></em></p>
        <p>
            For Customers that purchase our Subscription plans, fees are specified during the check-out process and in the Order Form(s) — and must be paid in advance. Payment obligations
            are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in the Contract, fees paid are non-refundable. For clarity, in the event Customer downgrades any subscriptions from a 
            paid plan to a free plan, Customer will remain responsible for any unpaid fees under the paid plan, and Services under the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered 
            upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscription term. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, 
            for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, <strong>"Taxes"</strong>). Customer will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated 
            with its purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Services be subject to withholding tax by any government, Customer will reimburse 
            us for such withholding tax.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Free Trial</b></em></p>
        <p>
            Customers subscribing to the free trial of paid monthly plans shall last for a period of 14 days. After the 14 day free trial, regular price for the pricing plan will be charged.

        </p>
        <p>
            Customers not wishing to continue the Hosting Service once the free trial ends must cancel the plan or downgrade from Accounts> Billing or email support@zenler.com. Reminder

        <p>
            If any fees owed to us by Customer (excluding amounts disputed reasonably and in good faith) are thirty (30) days or more overdue, we may, without limiting our other rights
            and remedies, downgrade any fee-based Services to free plans until those amounts are paid in full, so long as we have given Customer ten (10) or more days’ prior notice that
            its account is overdue. Notwithstanding the second paragraph of the "Providing the Services" section below, Customer acknowledges and agrees that a downgrade will result in
            a decrease in certain features and functionality and potential loss of access to Customer Data.

        <h2>Term and Termination</h2>
        <p><em><b>Contract Term</b></em></p>
        <p>
            As further described below, a free plan subscription continues until terminated, while a paid plan subscription has a term that may expire or be terminated. 
            The Contract remains effective until all subscriptions ordered under the Contract have expired or been terminated or the Contract itself terminates. Termination of the Contract 
            will terminate all subscriptions and all Order Forms.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Auto-Renewal</b></em></p>
        <p>
            Unless an Order Form says something different, (a) all subscriptions automatically renew for additional periods equal to one (1) year or the preceding term, whichever is 
            shorter; and (b) the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the immediately prior term. Either party can give the other notice 
            of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscriptions from automatically renewing.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Termination for Cause</b></em></p>
        <p>
            We or Customer may terminate the Contract on notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches the Contract and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days 
            after the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach. Customer is responsible for its Users, including for any breaches of this Contract caused by its Users. We may 
            terminate the Contract immediately on notice to Customer if we reasonably believe that the Services are being used by Customer or its Users in violation of applicable law.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Termination Without Cause</b></em></p>
        <p>
            You can cancel your account or cancel your subscriptions at any time without cause. In rare cases for violation of terms or long period of inactivity, we may also terminate 
            Customer’s free subscriptions without cause, but we will provide Customer with thirty (30) days prior written a notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            In rare cases for violation of terms, we may also terminate Customer’s paid subscriptions without cause, but we will provide Customer with thirty (30) days prior written a notice.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Effect of Termination</b></em></p>
        <p>
            Upon any termination for cause by Customer, we will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all subscriptions after the effective date of 
            termination. Upon any termination for cause by us, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of those subscriptions after the effective date of 
            termination. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Data Portability and Deletion</b></em></p>
        <p>
            We are custodians of Customer Data. During the term of a site’s subscriptions, Customer will be permitted to export or share certain Customer Data from the Services; provided, 
            however, that because we have different products with varying features and Customer has different retention options, Customer acknowledges and agrees that the ability to export 
            or share Customer Data may be limited or unavailable depending on the type of Services plan in effect and the data retention, sharing or invite settings enabled. Following 
            termination or expiration of a site’s subscriptions, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data and may thereafter, unless legally prohibited, 
            delete all Customer Data in our systems or otherwise in our possession or under our control.
        </p>
        <h2>Zenler API License</h2>

            Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Zenler grants You a worldwide, revocable, non-exclusive license, under Zenler copyrights, to Use the Zenler APIs to facilitate the 
            interoperability of the Zenler Solution and the Software Application solely for internal development or testing purposes. You are granted this license provided that You adhere 
            to the API Limits as a condition to receiving this license and that You do not attempt to circumvent any such API Limits. You also agree to not use the API to create or to be 
            used in a competing service or competing software.
        </p>
        <h2>Proper use of Zenler Trademarks and Logo</h2>
        <p>
            You may do any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that does not devalue, dilute, or disparage the Zenler brand ‐
        </p>
        <div style="margin-left:20px;">
            <p>
                a. Websites and Packaging.  On product website(s),  packaging,  advertising, and other collateral, use of a  Zenler Trademark must be less prominent  than  your  brand,  preferably by use of different type font, size, and color.  
            </p>
            <p>
                b. Separate Use. The Zenler Trademark must be used independently and separately from your trade names, service marks, logos or trademarks  (no combining of  Zenler Trademarks and your trade names, service marks, logos or trademarks is permitted).  
            </p>
            <p>
                c. Collective  Display.  Your own name, trademark or logo must be displayed  wherever  a Zenler Trademark is displayed.   
            </p>
            <p>
                d. Use as an Adjective. The Zenler Trademark must only be used as an adjective followed by a generic description of the branded goods or services the first time it is used in text, and as often as possible after that.
            </p>
            <p>
                e. First Use. The “®” or “™” symbol, as appropriate, must be included with the first or most prevalent use of the Zenler Trademark in materials on which it appears. For a listing of Zenler trademarks and their current status, please refer to Section 3. 
            </p>
            <p>
                f. Attribution. The appropriate trademark symbol (i.e., “®” or “™”) should appear at least with the first use of the Zenler Trademarks and all occurrences of the Zenler logo. An attribution statement must be included in a legend on the packaging,  splash  screens, web pages, and other materials where the  Zenler  Trademark(s)  appear.  The  statement should  read:  “Zenler,  [list  of  other  Zenler  marks  used]  is/are  either  registered trademarks or trademarks of Zenler Inc. in the United States and/or other countries.”  
            </p>
            <p>
                g. Exact Form. The Zenler Trademark must be used only in the exact form as indicated by Zenler
            </p>
            <p>
                h. Cessation of Use.  You must comply with a Zenler request to correct,  remedy,  or discontinue any use of the Zenler Trademark which is determined by Zenler to be improper under these guidelines.  This  section  applies  notwithstanding  any  trademark license you may have in place with Zenler. 
            </p>
            <p>
                i. Nominative Use. You may indicate that your product or service is related to a Zenler product or service by using an appropriate phrase, such as "for," "for use with," or "works with," as long as your usage does not create the impression of any partnership with or endorsement by Zenler, and as long as your usage does not create the possibility of confusion as to the source of the product.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Improper use of Zenler Trademarks and Logo</h2>
        <p>

You may not form a company, use a company name, or create a software or SaaS product name that includes the “Zenler” trademark or implies any corporate or authorship role of Zenler. If you have a software product that works with Zenler, it is suggested you use terms such as “[product name] for Zenler”.
            </p>
            <p>
                b. False or Misleading Statements. You may not make false or misleading statements regarding Zenler using the Zenler Trademarks (e.g., "Zenler Approved").

            <p>
                c. Domain Names and/or Search Terms. You must not use,  for example, Zenler, Zenler’s Trademarks or any confusingly similar phrase or any misspelled keywords in a domain name. For instance, examples like “www.zenlerdiscount.com”, “www.buyzenler.com” or variations with ‘Zenler’ word in the domain name is not allowed. You may not use a Zenler Trademark or any word or phrase similar to a Zenler Trademark as an ad word or search marketing term.
            </p>
            <p>
                d. Merchandise. You must not manufacture, sell or give away merchandise items, such as T‐shirts and mugs, bearing a Zenler logo.  If you wish to do this, please contact us and we will be happy to discuss a license.

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p><em><b>Confidential Information</b></em></p>
        <p>
            Each party (“<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>”) may disclose “<strong>Confidential Information</strong>” to the other party (“<strong>Receiving Party</strong>”) in connection with the Contract, which is anything that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure including all Order Forms, as well as non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data. If something is labeled “Confidential,” that’s a clear indicator to the Receiving Party that the material is confidential. Notwithstanding the above, Confidential Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Protection and Use of Confidential Information</b></em></p>
        <p>
            The Receiving Party will (a) take at least reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, and limit access to those instructors, agents, JV partners, support personnel, assistants, employees, affiliates and contractors who need to know such information in connection with the Contract; and (b) not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Contract. Nothing above will prevent either party from sharing Confidential Information with financial and legal advisors; provided, however, that the advisors are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in the Contract.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Compelled Access or Disclosure</b></em></p>
        <p>
            The Receiving Party may access or disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is required by law; provided, however, that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled access or disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the access or disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to access or disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing access to such Confidential Information as well as the reasonable cost for any support provided in connection with the Disclosing Party seeking a protective order or confidential treatment for the Confidential Information to be produced.
        </p>

        <p><em><b>Modifications</b></em></p>
        <p>

Customer can review the most current version of the Customer Terms at any time by visiting this page and by visiting the most current versions of the other pages that are referenced in the Contract. The materially revised Contract will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change. If Customer (or any User) accesses or uses the Services after the effective date, that use will constitute Customer’s acceptance of any revised terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Waiver</b></em></p>
        <p>
            No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the Contract will constitute a waiver of that right. No waiver under the Contract will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party being deemed to have granted the waiver.
        </p>
        <p><em><b>Severability</b></em></p>
        <p>
            The Contract will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. If any provision of the Contract is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the Contract will remain in effect.
        </p> 
        <p><em><b>Entire Agreement</b></em></p>
        <p>
            The Contract, including these Customer Terms and all referenced pages and Order Forms, if applicable, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. Without limiting the foregoing, the Contract supersedes the terms of any online agreement electronically accepted by Customer or any Users. However, to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these Customer Terms and any other documents or pages referenced in these Customer Terms, the following order of precedence will apply: (1) the terms of any Order Form (if any) (2) the Customer Terms and (4) finally any other documents or pages referenced in the Terms. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, no terms or conditions stated in a Customer purchase order, vendor onboarding process or web portal, or any other Customer order documentation (excluding Order Forms) will be incorporated into or form any part of the Contract, and all such terms or conditions will be null and void.
